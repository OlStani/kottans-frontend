# Git experience

Git is a powerful versioning tool that makes life easier for developers of all levels

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I worked with Linux and cli for the first time. Cli enables easy and convenient management of most processes.

HTTP is used for client-server communication. The URL is used to locate a server. I was most impressed by that the files in cash have an expiration date, after which the actuality of this file is checked on the server.

## Git Collaboration

Learned how to use Git through bash, how to create, add and combine commits, how to send and receive information from a remote repository. I was most impressed by the flexibility of the GitHub system.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

I have already learned a bit of html and css and this was a good opportunity to remember the basics.

## Responsive Web Design

The new thing is that you can add the minimum and maximum size of the section to the grid.

It was surprising to change the order of elements.

Grid and Flex allow you to place elements on the page in almost any way, so I will use most of the features.

## JS Basics

In this task, I learned to manipulate objects and arrays. I liked the methods of sorting arrays the most. I read about regular expressions for the first time. I think that I will use most of the methods in practice.

## DOM

In this exercise, I learned how to access DOM tree objects and change them depending on events on the page. Learned to listen to events. I liked addEventListener the most for its ease of use. Template string was new.

## Object Oriented JS

I learned what classes are and how they are. I understood what OOP is used for and where it is used.
