I worked with Linux and cli for the first time. Cli enables easy and convenient management of most processes.

HTTP is used for client-server communication. The URL is used to locate a server. I was most impressed by that the files in cash have an expiration date, after which the actuality of this file is checked on the server.

Learned how to use Git through bash, how to create, add and combine commits, how to send and receive information from a remote repository. I was most impressed by the flexibility of the GitHub system.
